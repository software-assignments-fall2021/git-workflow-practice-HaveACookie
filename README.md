# Git Practice
A simple project to practice a few git/github workflows.  Replace the contents of this file with the contents indicated in the [instructions](./instructions.md).
<p>Here is a link to an article on cross site scripting</p>
<a href="https://www.veracode.com/security/javascript-security#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20most%20common,return%20malicious%20scripts%20to%20visitors.&text=Another%20common%20JavaScript%20security%20vulnerability,Site%20Request%20Forgery%20(CSRF)."></a>

<p>As someone interested in web security, I find it very interesting that Javascript developers could potentially prevent multiple kinds of attacks (CSRF and XSS) by utilizing sandboxing (runing scripts seperatly so they dont have access to each other's information) and utilizing same origin policy (this is a protocol that prevents one site from accessing script data on another site) by writing their browsers to take these into account, but simply do not. These attacks make it easy for malicious users to steal data and spread malware across servers very easily when these vulnerabilities are identified. That being said, it is heartneing to see that there is a whole subgenre of software dedicated to strictly analyzing Javascript code to idenitfy these vulnerabilities and I would hope to have the opportunity to use one at some point this semester if possible.</p>
